      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>I'm Ankit, a 1st-year ENTC student at MITAOE. I have a passion for designing and building cool stuff on the web 🧠💻. Whether it’s creating websites, coding interactive features, or exploring new tech, I’m always diving deep into the digital world. My journey has just begun, and I'm excited to learn and grow along the way 🚀. I love experimenting with different technologies, from front-end design to back-end development, and making sure everything works smoothly. Every project I work on is an opportunity to challenge myself and push my limits. I’m constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and keep up with the latest trends in tech 🌐. I find it super rewarding when I can turn my ideas into something real and functional. Alongside my studies, I enjoy exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my web development knowledge. This is just the start, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me! 🌟.</p>
